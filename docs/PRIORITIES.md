2. Implement basic Streamlit interface with navigation
3. Build PostgreSQL log parser
4. Develop database connection management
5. Create query analyzer for detecting slow queries
6. Implement index recommendation engine
7. Build basic dashboard with metrics
8. Develop SQL script generation for recommendations
9. Create comprehensive testing suite
10. Document MVP features and usage

### Success Criteria

- Successfully parse standard PostgreSQL log formats
- Connect to PostgreSQL databases securely
- Generate accurate index recommendations
- Produce executable SQL scripts for implementation
- Deliver intuitive Streamlit interface for all features
- Meet performance requirements for log processing

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team

- 1 Full-stack Python Developer
- 1 PostgreSQL DBA/Expert (part-time)
- 1 UI/UX Designer (part-time)

### Infrastructure

- Development environment with PostgreSQL instances
- Test databases with various schemas and workloads
- Sample log files of varying sizes and formats
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Inaccurate recommendations | High | Medium | Extensive testing with real-world workloads |
| Performance issues with large logs | High | High | Implement streaming parsing and sampling |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Secure credential handling and penetration testing |
| Compatibility issues with PostgreSQL versions | Medium | Medium | Version-specific code paths and comprehensive testing |
| Complexity of query analysis | Medium | High | Start with common patterns and iterate |

## Conclusion

The phased approach allows for the incremental delivery of value, with the highest-priority features (query optimization) delivered first. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for user feedback to inform later development phases. The Phase 1 MVP focuses specifically on the core query optimization capabilities requested, providing immediate value to database administrators while establishing the foundation for more advanced features.
