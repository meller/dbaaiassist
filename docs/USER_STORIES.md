## User Personas

### 1. Dana - Database Administrator
Dana is a full-time DBA responsible for maintaining dozens of PostgreSQL databases across multiple applications. She is experienced with PostgreSQL but is constantly pressed for time and looking for tools to automate routine performance tuning.

### 2. Alex - Application Developer
Alex is a backend developer who works with PostgreSQL databases but does not have deep database optimization expertise. He needs help identifying performance issues in his application's queries.

### 3. Maya - DevOps Engineer
Maya manages infrastructure including database servers. She needs to ensure databases are properly configured and running optimally without necessarily understanding all the details of query optimization.

### 4. Raj - Data Scientist
Raj works with large datasets in PostgreSQL and writes complex analytical queries. He needs to optimize these queries but doesn't always have time to manually analyze execution plans.
